      <p>Im a animal person and I love cats they are great companions to have as they provide stress relief and a feeling of comfort, i currently do not own any cats but my roomates do and I aboslutly adore them </p>
      <p>Cats are not only adorable but also come in many different breeds and varieties. Each breed has its own unique traits and characteristics, making them fascinating companions. I love how there personalities are always different which always makes me wonder what they are thinking about.</p>
      <p>Currently I live with three cats that are all owned by my roomates one is named Vanilla bean one is named Mcflurry and the last one is named Lado</p>
