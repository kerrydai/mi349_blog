        <h2>Level Up: Tips for Becoming More Confident on the Soccer Field</h2>
        <img src="socc.jpg" alt="Soccer">
        <p>Published on February 02, 2022 by TSX</p>
        <p>Soccer is a sport enjoyed around the world, and for a good reason: all you need to get into the game are two goals, a ball, and a friend or two. However, as fun as it is to kick a soccer ball around with your buddies, it can be tough not to put pressure on yourself during tryouts, games, and tournaments. If you lack confidence on the soccer field, you’re holding yourself back from being the best soccer player that you can be. Expanding your confidence on the soccer field will help you become a winner both in the game and in life, and these tips will be sure to give you the extra confidence you need to make every part of soccer fun — even with eyes on you.</p>
        <p>Practice Positive Self-Talk</p>
        <p>Have you ever noticed the voice inside your head taunting you after you miss a shot or make a bad pass? Being hard on yourself with statements like “I’m never going to make that shot,” “We always lose,” or “I stink at soccer” are a result of negative self-talk. The first step you should take when seeking to gain confidence on the soccer field is to replace negative self-talk with positive self-talk. “I can do this,” “Good pass,” and “We can win” are all examples of mantras to repeat to yourself. If you have difficulty being positive, replace negative self-talk with instructional self-talk instead and become your own mental “coach.”</p>
